**enyo** is a Discord-like live chat app with (fake) servers and (real) channels.


# Servers

enyo servers can be created and then shared with friends via an invite code. Their owners can edit or delete them, and create new **channels** within them.

# Channels

The owner of an enyo server can add separate channels in which users can message.
